# Credit_Scoring_app
A machine learning–based Credit Scoring Model that predicts the likelihood of loan default using customer financial data. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, it achieved ~89% accuracy and helped reduce potential loan risk exposure by 17%. Deployed with Streamlit for real-time risk predictions and credit score generation
# 💳 Credit Score Prediction Model

This project is an **AI-powered Credit Scoring System** that predicts a customer's likelihood of defaulting on a loan based on their financial and demographic information.  
It uses **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn)** models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to generate risk predictions and assign a **Credit Score (300–850)** similar to real-world credit systems.
